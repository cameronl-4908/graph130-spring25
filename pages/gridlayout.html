            <h1>Pure CSS Grid Layout</h1>
            <p>Graphic and web-designers work in the dimension that can be broken down to the rectangle, be it a page or a screen. This determines the shape of the grid as well. The lines within the grid are customized. Creators can build the grid themselves or rely on ready grid systems, while designers can use the same grid system throughout the whole piece of design, or create a new grid for each page to express their ideas. <a href="https://www.eleken.co/blog-posts/grid-layout-design-history-tips-and-best-examples Links to an external site." target="_blank">eleken.co</a></p>

                <h2>Whidbey Island</h2>
                <h3><i>By Carlina Duan</i></h3>
                <p>on the trail, we walk past stinging nettle, draping
                    in eloquent green stalks down the path: <i>If you're stung</i></p>

                <p>know it will pass. a younger self once refused to listenâ€”
                    ignorant to the worlds laced within a decomposing</p>

                <p>hemlock tree. am I older now, old enough to coax
                    the thimbleberry off the bud, soft and already summoning</p>

                <p>a slippery red sugar between my fingers? we pass by
                    an eagle's feather, pristine and white, large atop the moss.</p>

                <p>behind the moon, time howls, and I remember how,
                    this summer, sweeping your grave for the first time,</p>

                <p>pine needles, not dust, clung to my open hands.
                    T played the voicemail her daughter had recorded</p>

                <p>for you: I miss you; I've missed you for so many years, while
                    on & on, the soft spool of my childhood glistened:</p>

                <p>summers I returned to you, bearing supermarket ice cream cones
                    enshrined in plastic. breakfasts by the white clock, your back</p>

                <p>a turned frame depositing tea leaf eggs softly into a plastic blue
                    bowl. clink, clink, remember? peeling open those eggs with our</p>

                <p>hands, the whole morning resplendent with steam and salt
                    so that, even now, time thickening the distance between us,</p>

                <p>I follow you in each leafy shadow, each lithe branch. if I cast
                    a prayer, speak Revere, Reverence, I might watch the water wrinkle</p>

                <p>with sound. of course, you knew little about the natural world
                    and, living across oceans, could never have talked to me</p>

                <p>about sword ferns or overripe figs splitting at the seams.
                    but when I walk, I sense We in the stones, the firs, the webs</p>

                <p>bound by some other nameless creature with legs.
                    nearby, your mouth plays truant in the light.</p>

                <h2>In Search of the White Whale</h2>
                <h3><i>By Jose A. Alcantra</i></h3>
                <p>Just as a fishing boat passes<br>
                    between me and the rising sun</p>

                <p>a harpoon rips through the hull<br>
                    obliterating craft and crew</p>

                <p>a harpoon hurled eight minutes<br>
                    and ninety-three million miles ago</p>

                <p>yet timed perfectly<br>
                    as if the sun knew</p>

                <p>that I would set my alarm<br>
                    for six forty-five</p>

                <p>knew how long it would take<br>
                    for me to get dressed</p>

                <p>to brush my teeth, to stumble<br>
                    around looking for my glasses</p>

                <p>to walk the quarter-mile to the bay<br>
                    so that I would come out of the trees</p>

                <p>at the exact moment when boat and sun<br>
                    and eye make a direct line.</p>

                <p>Two seconds later, the boat,<br>
                    somehow put back together again;</p>

                <p>the whale, racing away<br>
                    at the speed of light.</p>

                <h2>The Cove</h2>
                <h3><i>By Seth Rosenbloom</i></h3>
                <p>I'm resting on a tide-bleached tree, and you</p>
                <p>are looking for stones. Like we've always done,</p>
                <p>from back when our son was little. But now,</p>
                <p>it's up to us to fill in the bucket. Stones lapped</p>
                <p>smooth by the force of the moon. Pigmented</p>
                <p>in colors of sibling planets. Mars-red. Jupiters</p>
                <p>with ghostly rings. You're too far away to hear,</p>
                <p>and there is no pain, so I won't make a fuss. It's just</p>
                <p>thumps in my throat. My pulse runs up numbers</p>
                <p>on the screen of my watch, even as I sit here, still.</p>
                <p>My mind re-walks the trail through the forest</p>
                <p>to where the headlands open. Down the switchback.</p>
                <p>Past fallen old growths, their upended roots spider</p>
                <p>towards the sky. We're the only ones who hiked here</p>
                <p>today. Even if there were cell coverage, how many hours</p>
                <p>before help arrives? So, breathe, bear down on the abdomen</p>
                <p>like the cardiologist said. Listen to the wind rush</p>
                <p>into this mouth of salinity. This cove, embraced by hills</p>
                <p>that shoulder hemlocks. Lava born from the mantel,</p>
                <p>cooled into outcrops, carved to pool star fish and purple</p>
                <p>anemones. Home of endless give and take.</p>
