                    <h2>Whidbey Island</h2>
                    <h3><i>By Carlina Duan</i></h3>
                    <p>on the trail, we walk past stinging nettle, draping
                    in eloquent green stalks down the path: <i>If you're stung</i>,</p>

                    <p>know it will pass. a younger self once refused to listen—
                    ignorant to the worlds laced within a decomposing</p>

                    <p>hemlock tree. am I older now, old enough to coax
                    the thimbleberry off the bud, soft and already summoning</p>

                    <p>a slippery red sugar between my fingers? we pass by
                    an eagle's feather, pristine and white, large atop the moss.</p>

                    <p>behind the moon, time howls, and I remember how,
                    this summer, sweeping your grave for the first time,</p>

                    <p>pine needles, not dust, clung to my open hands.
                    T played the voicemail her daughter had recorded</p>

                    <p>for you: I miss you; I've missed you for so many years, while
                    on & on, the soft spool of my childhood glistened:</p>

                    <p>summers I returned to you, bearing supermarket ice cream cones
                    enshrined in plastic. breakfasts by the white clock, your back</p>

                    <p>a turned frame depositing tea leaf eggs softly into a plastic blue
                    bowl. clink, clink, remember? peeling open those eggs with our</p>

                    <p>hands, the whole morning resplendent with steam and salt
                    so that, even now, time thickening the distance between us,</p>

                    <p>I follow you in each leafy shadow, each lithe branch. if I cast
                    a prayer, speak Revere, Reverence, I might watch the water wrinkle</p>

                    <p>with sound. of course, you knew little about the natural world
                    and, living across oceans, could never have talked to me</p>

                    <p>about sword ferns or overripe figs splitting at the seams.
                    but when I walk, I sense We in the stones, the firs, the webs</p>

                    <p>bound by some other nameless creature with legs.
                    nearby, your mouth plays truant in the light.</p>

                    <h2>In Search of the White Whale</h2>
                    <h3><i>By Jose A. Alcantra</i></h3>
                    <p>Just as a fishing boat passes<br>
                    between me and the rising sun</p>

                    <p>a harpoon rips through the hull<br>
                    obliterating craft and crew</p>

                    <p>a harpoon hurled eight minutes<br>
                    and ninety-three million miles ago</p>

                    <p>yet timed perfectly<br>
                    as if the sun knew</p>

                    <p>that I would set my alarm<br>
                    for six forty-five</p>

                    <p>knew how long it would take<br>
                    for me to get dressed</p>

                    <p>to brush my teeth, to stumble<br>
                    around looking for my glasses</p>

                    <p>to walk the quarter-mile to the bay<br>
                    so that I would come out of the trees</p>

                    <p>at the exact moment when boat and sun<br>
                    and eye make a direct line.</p>

                    <p>Two seconds later, the boat,<br>
                    somehow put back together again;</p>

                    <p>the whale, racing away<br>
                    at the speed of light.</p>

                    <h2>The Cove</h2>
                    <h3><i>By Seth Rosenbloom</i></h3>
                    <p>I'm resting on a tide-bleached tree, and you</p>
                    <p>are looking for stones. Like we've always done,</p>
                    <p>from back when our son was little. But now,</p>
                    <p>it's up to us to fill in the bucket. Stones lapped</p>
                    <p>smooth by the force of the moon. Pigmented</p>
                    <p>in colors of sibling planets. Mars-red. Jupiters</p>
                    <p>with ghostly rings. You're too far away to hear,</p>
                    <p>and there is no pain, so I won't make a fuss. It's just</p>
                    <p>thumps in my throat. My pulse runs up numbers</p>
                    <p>on the screen of my watch, even as I sit here, still.</p>
                    <p>My mind re-walks the trail through the forest</p>
                    <p>to where the headlands open. Down the switchback.</p>
                    <p>Past fallen old growths, their upended roots spider</p>
                    <p>towards the sky. We're the only ones who hiked here</p>
                    <p>today. Even if there were cell coverage, how many hours</p>
                    <p>before help arrives? So, breathe, bear down on the abdomen</p>
                    <p>like the cardiologist said. Listen to the wind rush</p>
                    <p>into this mouth of salinity. This cove, embraced by hills</p>
                    <p>that shoulder hemlocks. Lava born from the mantel,</p>
                    <p>cooled into outcrops, carved to pool star fish and purple</p>
                    <p>anemones. Home of endless give and take.</p>
